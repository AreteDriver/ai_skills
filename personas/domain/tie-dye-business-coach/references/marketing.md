# Marketing for Tie-Dye Businesses

## Marketing Hierarchy (Do in Order)

1. **Optimize Etsy SEO first** (free, compounds over time)
2. **Collect emails** (own your audience)
3. **Choose ONE social platform** (master it)
4. **Build repeat customer system** (cheaper than new customers)
5. **Only then**: Paid ads, influencers, etc.

## Email Marketing

### Why Email > Social
- You own the list (no algorithm changes)
- 40x higher conversion than social
- Direct communication with buyers

### Start Collecting Immediately
- Package insert with QR code to signup
- Etsy message after purchase: "Join for 10% off next order"
- Website popup (if you have one)

### Email Frequency
Start with monthly, increase if engagement is good

### Email Content Ideas
- New product drops
- Behind-the-scenes process
- Limited editions / early access
- Customer features
- Sale announcements (sparingly)

### Tools
- Mailchimp (free up to 500 contacts)
- Flodesk ($38/mo, beautiful templates)

## Social Media Strategy

### Platform Selection

Pick ONE based on your strengths:

**Instagram**
- Best for: Visual products like tie-dye
- Requires: Good photos, consistent posting, Reels
- Audience: 25-45, style-conscious
- Content: Process videos, flat-lays, styling

**TikTok**
- Best for: Highest organic reach currently
- Requires: Video comfort, trending audio awareness
- Audience: Younger, discovery-focused
- Content: Process videos, satisfying dye reveals, day-in-life

**Pinterest**
- Best for: Long-term traffic builder
- Requires: Consistent pinning, keyword research
- Audience: Planning purchases, DIY interested
- Content: Product pins, tutorials, inspiration boards

**Facebook**
- Best for: Older audience, groups
- Requires: Community engagement, group participation
- Audience: 35+, gift buyers
- Content: Customer photos, lives, group engagement

### Content Pillars (Pick 3-4)

1. **Process content**: Dyeing process, reveals, time-lapses
2. **Product showcases**: New items, styled shots
3. **Behind-the-scenes**: Workspace, packing orders, real life
4. **Educational**: Tie-dye tips, care instructions
5. **Customer features**: User-generated content, reviews
6. **Personal**: Why you started, your story, values

### Posting Frequency

**Realistic schedule for solo maker**:
- Instagram: 3-4x/week feed, daily stories
- TikTok: 3-5x/week
- Pinterest: 5-10 pins/day (can schedule in advance)

**Batch content**: Dedicate one day to photo/video, schedule for the week

## Craft Fairs & Markets

### When Worth It
- Local brand awareness
- Direct customer feedback
- Cash flow (immediate payment)
- Email list building

### When Not Worth It
- Booth fee > 3x expected sales
- Takes significant production time
- Weather-dependent outdoor markets
- Too far from home

### Calculate Hourly Rate
```
(Sales - booth fee - materials) ÷ hours
(include setup, teardown, travel)
```

## Influencer & Affiliate Marketing

### Micro-Influencers (1K-10K followers)
Often trade for product, authentic engagement

### Approach
1. Find people who already wear tie-dye/boho style
2. Gift product, no strings
3. If they post organically, propose ongoing relationship

### Affiliate Program (Later Stage)
- Give affiliates unique discount code
- Track sales by code
- Pay 10-15% commission

## Wholesale Opportunities

### Approach Boutiques When
- You can consistently fulfill orders
- You have line sheets/catalog
- Margins work at 50% off retail

### How to Pitch
1. Visit in person with samples
2. Leave catalog and contact info
3. Follow up in 1-2 weeks
4. Start with local shops

## Content That Converts

**High-performing tie-dye content**:
- Dye reveal videos (before → after)
- Ice melting time-lapses
- Satisfying folding/dyeing process
- Custom order behind-the-scenes
- "How I made this" tutorials

## Marketing Budget Allocation

### At $0-1K/month Revenue
- $0 marketing spend
- All organic content

### At $1-5K/month
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Email platform | $0-38 |
| Canva Pro | $13/mo |
| Etsy ads (optional) | $50-100/mo on proven listings |

### At $5K+/month
- Consider small influencer gifts
- Market booth fees
- Potentially: photographer, content creator

## Marketing Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------------|
| Running ads before optimizing listings | Throwing money away |
| Being on every platform | Spreading too thin |
| Not collecting emails | Renting audience instead of owning |
| Inconsistent posting | Algorithm punishes gaps |
| Only promotional content | No engagement, unfollows |
| Ignoring existing customers | Acquisition > retention cost |
