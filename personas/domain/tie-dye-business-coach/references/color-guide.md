## Color Mixing Results

### What Happens When Colors Touch
| Color A + Color B = Result |
|---------------------------|
| Blue + Yellow = Green |
| Red + Yellow = Orange |
| Red + Blue = Purple |
| Turquoise + Fuchsia = Purple (vibrant) |
| Yellow + Fuchsia = Red/Orange |
| Yellow + Turquoise = Green |
| All three primaries = Brown/Gray (avoid) |

### Colors That Muddy
**Avoid placing these adjacent:**
- Red + Green (complementary = brown)
- Orange + Blue (complementary = brown)
- Purple + Yellow (complementary = brown)
- Too many colors touching = mud

**Pro tip:** Use white space (undyed) to separate complementary colors

## Technique-Specific Color Tips

### Spiral Pattern
- Start with lightest color in center
- Work outward to darker colors
- Leave some white wedges for pop
- 6 sections = rainbow, 3 sections = tricolor

### Ice Dye
- Black dye splits into beautiful components
- Use multiple colors for "galaxy" effect
- Colors blend more than squeeze bottle
- Results less predictable, more organic

### Crumple/Scrunch
- Use 2-4 colors max to avoid mud
- Apply randomly but with intention
- Colors will blend at edges
- Great for beginners

### Geode/Mandala
- Concentric color rings
- Plan color order before starting
- High contrast between adjacent rings
- Time-intensive but stunning

### Reverse Tie-Dye (Bleach)
- Start with dark colored shirt (black, navy)
- Bleach removes color in pattern
- Can over-dye bleached areas
- Use bleach neutralizer (hydrogen peroxide)

## Color for Different Garment Colors

### Starting with White
- All colors work
- Brightest, most vibrant results
- Standard approach

### Starting with Natural/Cream
- Slightly warmer results
- Vintage/earthy feel
- Works well with warm palettes

### Starting with Light Colors
- Dye color + shirt color = result
- Yellow shirt + blue dye = green areas
- Experiment first

### Starting with Dark Colors
- Limited options
- Bleach discharge first, then over-dye
- Or embrace reverse tie-dye

## Troubleshooting Color Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Colors too pale | Insufficient dye | Increase concentration |
| Colors too pale | Short cure time | Cure 24+ hours |
| Colors muddy | Complementary mixing | Use white space between |
| Colors washed out | Fabric not prepped | Soda ash soak required |
| Black splitting | Normal behavior | Use or avoid intentionally |
| Uneven color | Poor dye distribution | Apply more dye, massage |
| White areas dyed | Dye migration | Tie tighter, less dye |
| Colors bleeding after wash | Incomplete rinse | Rinse until water clear |
