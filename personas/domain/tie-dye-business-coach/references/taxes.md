## Sales Tax

### Who Collects

### If Selling Outside Etsy

- You may need to register in states where you have nexus
- Oregon has no state sales tax

### Sales Tax Checklist

1. Register for seller's permit in home state (if applicable)

3. Keep records of where sales go
4. File returns even in months with no sales (if registered)

## Tax Calculation Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross revenue | $30,000 |
| COGS | -$8,000 |
| Operating expenses | -$5,000 |
| **Net profit** | **$17,000** |

| Federal income tax (~12%) | $2,040 |
| **Total tax liability** | **~$4,641** |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not separating business/personal**: Makes audit risk higher, deductions questionable
2. **Missing deductions**: Track everything, especially small purchases
3. **Forgetting quarterly payments**: Underpayment penalties add up
4. **Not tracking inventory**: Required for COGS calculation
5. **Ignoring hobby loss rules**: If no profit in 3 of 5 years, IRS may classify as hobby (lose deductions)

## When to Get Professional Help

**Consider a CPA or tax pro when**:
- Revenue exceeds $50K
- Considering S-corp election
- First year of business (setup right)
- You're getting audited
- Multi-state sales tax complexity

**Cost**: $200-500 for basic Schedule C return

- [ ] Categorize all expenses

- [ ] Compile 1099s received
- [ ] Calculate home office deduction (if applicable)
