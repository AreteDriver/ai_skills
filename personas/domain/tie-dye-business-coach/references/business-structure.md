# Business Structure for Craft Businesses

## When to Form an LLC

**Consider LLC when**:
- Annual revenue exceeds $10-15K
- You have business assets to protect
- You want liability separation (someone sues over a product)
- You're hiring help (even contractors)
- You want to appear more professional to wholesale buyers

**Stay sole proprietor if**:
- Just starting out, testing the market
- Revenue under $10K/year
- Low liability risk
- Keeping things simple is the priority

## Sole Proprietorship (Default)

**What it is**: You and your business are legally the same entity.

**Pros**:
- Zero paperwork to start
- File taxes on personal return (Schedule C)
- Simple record-keeping

**Cons**:
- Personal assets at risk if sued
- Harder to establish business credit
- Perceived as less "legitimate" by some

**Requirements**:
- Business license (check city/county)
- DBA filing if using a business name (varies by state)

## LLC (Limited Liability Company)

**What it is**: Legal entity separate from you personally.

**Pros**:
- Personal assets protected from business liabilities
- More credibility with buyers, banks
- Easier to bring on partners later
- Can choose tax treatment (default pass-through or elect S-corp)

**Cons**:
- Formation costs: $50-500 depending on state
- Annual fees in many states ($25-800+)
- More paperwork and formality required
- Must maintain separation (no co-mingling funds)

## State-by-State Considerations

**Oregon example**:
- LLC filing fee: $100 online
- Annual report: $100
- No sales tax (simplifies things!)
- Register at: sos.oregon.gov

**General process**:
1. Check name availability with Secretary of State
2. File Articles of Organization
3. Get EIN from IRS (free, irs.gov)
4. Open business bank account
5. Create simple Operating Agreement (single-member is easy)

## Business Bank Account

**Why separate**:
- Required to maintain LLC protection
- Makes tax prep vastly easier
- Looks professional for payments
- Tracks true business finances

**Options for small business**:
- Local credit union (often free)
- Online banks: Novo, Relay, Mercury (free, designed for small business)
- Avoid: Big banks with high fees

## Insurance Considerations

**General Liability Insurance**: $300-500/year
- Covers: Customer injury, property damage, product issues
- Required by: Some craft fairs, wholesale buyers
- Providers: Hiscox, NEXT, The Hartford

**Product Liability**: Usually included in general liability for small makers

## Permits & Licenses

**Typically needed**:
- Business license (city/county level)
- State seller's permit (for collecting sales tax, if applicable)
- Home occupation permit (if working from home, check local zoning)

**Not usually needed for tie-dye**:
- Food handler's permit (not food!)
- Professional licenses

## Trademarks

**When to consider**:
- Unique business name you want to protect
- Logo you've invested in
- After you've validated the business model

**DIY vs. attorney**:
- DIY USPTO filing: ~$350
- Attorney-assisted: $1000-2500
- Start with state trademark (cheaper) if budget limited
