# Scaling Tie-Dye Production

## Bottleneck Analysis

Before scaling, identify your limiting factor:

1. **Time**: How many items can you produce per week?
2. **Space**: Curing racks, drying area, workspace
3. **Cash flow**: Can you buy materials for larger batches?
4. **Sales**: Are you selling what you already make?

**Rule**: Only scale production after you're consistently selling out.

## Batch Production System

### Optimal Batch Sizes

**Solo maker**:
| Batch Type | Size | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| Small | 10-15 items | Testing new designs |
| Standard | 20-30 items | Efficient dye use |
| Large | 40-50 items | Maximum solo efficiency |

### Batch Efficiency Tips

**Prep day** (batch tasks):
- Pre-wash and dry all blanks
- Mix large quantities of dye
- Cut plastic wrap, prepare workstation
- Pre-tie items (can do while watching TV)

**Dye day**:
- Apply dye to entire batch
- Same technique across batch (spiral Monday, geode Tuesday)
- Wrap and rack for curing

**Process day**:
- Rinse, wash, dry entire batch
- Quality check
- Photograph same-style items together

**Listing day**:
- Write/photograph similar items together
- Batch edit photos
- Schedule listings to post over time

## Time Optimization

### Time per Item Targets

| Technique | Active Time |
|-----------|-------------|
| Simple spiral tee | 15-20 min |
| Complex geode/mandala | 45-60 min |
| Ice dye | 10 min active (long cure) |

### Biggest Time Saves
- Batch same techniques together
- Pre-tie while doing other things (TV, podcasts)
- Invest in efficient rinse setup (utility sink, multiple buckets)
- Use washing machine for final wash (mesh bags)

## Space Requirements

### Minimum Workspace
| Area | Size/Capacity |
|------|---------------|
| Dye station | 4x6 ft table |
| Curing rack | Holds current batch (wire shelving) |
| Rinse station | Utility sink or outdoor setup |
| Drying area | Clothing rack or line |
| Storage | Blank inventory, dye supplies |

### Scaling Space
- Add curing rack capacity before production capacity
- Consider outdoor curing in good weather
- Dedicated dye room (waterproof flooring) as you grow

## Inventory Management

### Blank Inventory

**Formula**: 2-4 weeks of projected sales in blank inventory

**Why stock blanks**:
- Bulk discounts (usually at 24+ pieces)
- Always ready for flash orders
- Reduces per-order shipping costs

**Reorder trigger**: When stock hits 1 week of projected sales

### Made-to-Order vs. Ready-to-Ship

| Made-to-Order | Ready-to-Ship |
|---------------|---------------|
| Lower inventory risk | Faster shipping (customers love this) |
| Custom options easy | Higher conversion rate |
| Longer lead time | Risk of unsold inventory |
| Can't do flash sales | Enables same-day shipping |

**Hybrid approach**: Keep best-sellers in stock, custom options made-to-order

## Hiring Help

### When to Consider
- Can't keep up with orders
- Spending time on tasks anyone could do
- Business can afford $15-25/hour
- Clear systems documented

### First Hire Priorities (in order)

1. **Packing/shipping**: Easy to delegate, big time save
2. **Rinsing/washing**: Physical, repetitive
3. **Photography**: If you're not great at it
4. **Actual dyeing**: Last to delegate (your signature)

### How to Hire
- Start with per-project contractor
- Friends/family for simple tasks (pay them!)
- Local art students for skilled work
- Document everything before hiring

## Systems & SOPs

**Document these processes**:
- Dye mixing ratios
- Each fold technique step-by-step
- Rinse process
- Photography setup
- Listing template
- Packing checklist
- Shipping process

**Why**: Even if you never hire, SOPs improve consistency and let you improve systematically.

## Equipment Upgrades (In Order of Impact)

1. **Utility sink**: Speeds rinsing 3x
2. **Wire curing rack**: More capacity, airflow
3. **Quality squeeze bottles**: Faster application, less waste
4. **Commercial washer** (high volume): Faster, larger capacity
5. **Dedicated workspace**: Eliminates setup/teardown time

## Scaling Math

**Know your numbers**:

| Metric | Your Number |
|--------|-------------|
| Items per week capacity | ___ |
| Average selling price | $___ |
| Cost per item | $___ |
| Net profit per item | $___ |
| Max weekly revenue | capacity × avg price |
| Max weekly profit | capacity × net profit |

**Scaling question**: What would double capacity? New equipment, help, better systems?

## Warning Signs You're Scaling Wrong

- Quality declining with volume
- Burnout / hating the work
- Cash flow negative (inventory eating profit)
- Selling at a loss to "grow"
- Sacrificing uniqueness for efficiency

## Scaling Decision Framework

### Before adding capacity, ask:

1. Am I selling everything I make? (If no, scale marketing not production)
2. What's my current bottleneck? (Only fix the bottleneck)
3. Will this investment pay for itself? (Calculate ROI)
4. Can I maintain quality? (Quality is the product)
5. Do I actually want to grow? (Bigger isn't always better)

## Growth Path Options

| Path | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| Stay Small | Hobby/side income | Low stress, full control | Limited income |
| Solo Scale | Maximize personal output | Keep all profit | Your ceiling is your time |
| Small Team | 1-2 helpers | More capacity | Management overhead |
| Production | Employees, systems | Significant income | Becomes a "job" |
| Teaching | Courses, workshops | Passive income | Different skill set |
