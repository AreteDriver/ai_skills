**Minimum viable price** = (Materials + Labor + Overhead) × 2

## Materials Cost

Include everything:
- Blank garment (shirt, hoodie, etc.)
- Dye cost per item (total dye cost ÷ items dyed)
- Soda ash, urea, other chemicals
- Packaging (bag, tissue, thank you card)

## Don't Compete on Price

Handmade cannot compete with mass-produced. You compete on:
- **Uniqueness**: One-of-a-kind patterns
- **Quality**: Better blanks, Procion dyes
- **Story**: Your process, your values
- **Customer experience**: Custom orders, fast communication
- **Niche focus**: Plus sizes, eco-friendly, specific techniques

## Tiered Pricing Structure

**Good-Better-Best model**:

| Tier | Description | Margin |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Good | Simple designs, budget blanks | Lower entry point |
| Better | Signature designs, quality blanks | Core price point |
| Best | Premium blanks, complex techniques | Higher margin |

## Pricing by Product

| Product | Minimum | Target | Premium |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| Adult T-shirt (simple) | $25 | $35-45 | $50+ |
| Adult T-shirt (complex) | $40 | $50-65 | $80+ |
| Youth T-shirt | $20 | $25-35 | $40+ |
| Hoodie | $50 | $65-85 | $100+ |
| Crewneck | $40 | $55-70 | $85+ |
| Custom order (any) | +20-50% | — | — |
| Rush order (<1 week) | +25-50% | — | — |

## Custom Order Premium

Add 20-50% for custom work because:
- Requires communication time
- Can't batch efficiently
- Higher risk of redo requests
- Unique value to customer

## Wholesale vs. Retail

If considering wholesale to boutiques:
- **Wholesale price** = Cost × 2 (your minimum)
- **Retail price** = Wholesale × 2
- Boutiques expect 50% margin (keystone markup)

| Scenario | Your Price | Store Sells At |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| T-shirt cost: $15 | Wholesale: $30 | Retail: $60 |

## When to Raise Prices

Raise prices when:
- Materials costs increase
- Demand exceeds capacity
- You're consistently selling out
- Reviews mention "great value" (you're underpriced)
- Competition research shows you're low

**How to raise**:
- Raise new listings first
- Grandfather existing listings
- Gradually increase over 2-3 months

## Discount Strategy

Avoid frequent sales—trains customers to wait.

**Acceptable discounts**:
- Bundle deals (buy 2, save 10%)
- Seconds/imperfect items (20-30% off, clearly marked)
- Loyalty codes for repeat customers
- Clearance on discontinued styles

**Never**:
- Discount for "exposure"
- Race to bottom on price
- Constant sales/coupons
