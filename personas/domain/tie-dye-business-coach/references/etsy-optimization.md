# Etsy Optimization for Tie-Dye Sellers

## Etsy Search Algorithm Basics

Etsy's search prioritizes:

1. **Relevancy**: Title/tags match search query
2. **Listing quality score**: Conversion rate, favorites, clicks
3. **Recency**: Recently renewed/created listings get temporary boost
4. **Shop quality**: Reviews, response time, complete policies

## Title Optimization

**Structure**: `[Primary Keyword] [Secondary Keyword] - [Descriptive Details] - [Occasion/Style]`

**Example**: `Tie Dye T-Shirt Spiral Pattern - Handmade Cotton Tee - Festival Clothing Hippie Boho`

**Rules**:
- Put most important keywords first (Etsy weighs early words more)
- Use all 140 characters
- Don't repeat words—Etsy counts them once
- Include: technique, garment type, style, occasion, gift-worthiness

## Tag Strategy

13 tags maximum. Use all 13.

**Tag categories to cover**:
- Product type: "tie dye shirt", "hand dyed tee"
- Technique: "spiral tie dye", "ice dye", "shibori"
- Style: "hippie clothing", "boho fashion", "festival wear"
- Occasion: "summer shirt", "gift for her", "birthday gift"
- Descriptors: "colorful", "unique", "handmade"
- Long-tail: "custom tie dye shirt", "plus size tie dye"

**Research method**: Search Etsy, note autocomplete suggestions. These are high-volume searches.

## Photography Checklist

Minimum 5 photos per listing:

1. **Hero shot**: Item flat-lay or on model, white/neutral background
2. **Detail shot**: Close-up of dye pattern, fabric texture
3. **Scale shot**: Item worn or with size reference
4. **Process shot**: Work in progress (builds value)
5. **Lifestyle shot**: Styled in context

**Technical specs**: Square 1:1, minimum 2000x2000px, natural lighting preferred

## Pricing Psychology

- End in .00 or .95 (not .99—looks cheap for handmade)
- Free shipping threshold: $35+ (qualifies for Etsy's free shipping badge)
- Price anchor: Have a higher-priced "premium" option to make standard look reasonable

## Listing Refresh Strategy

- Renew top performers weekly (costs $0.20)
- Update underperformers' photos/tags before renewing
- Post new listings during peak hours: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm buyer's timezone

## Shop Sections

Organize by:
- Garment type (Shirts, Hoodies, Kids)
- Technique (Spiral, Ice Dye, Geode)
- Collection (Seasonal, Best Sellers)

## Conversion Optimization

**Quick wins**:
- Add size chart image
- Show garment on multiple body types if possible
- Include care instructions in description
- Mention production time prominently
- Add "made to order" vs "ready to ship" clarity

## Etsy Ads (When to Use)

Only after:
- Conversion rate > 1%
- Minimum 20 quality listings
- Strong reviews (4.5+)

Start with $1-5/day on top performers only. Watch ROAS (return on ad spend)—pause anything below 2x.
